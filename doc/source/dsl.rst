DSL versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some changes in CCP framework are backward compatible and some of them are not.
To prevent situations when service definitions are being processed by
incompatible version of CCP framework, DSL versioning has been implemented.

DSL versioning is based on Semantic Versioning model. Version has a format
``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`` and is being defined in ``dsl_version`` field of
:file:`fuel_ccp/__init__.py` module. Each service definition contains
``dsl_version`` field with the version of DSL it was implemented/updated for.

During the validation phase of :command:`ccp deploy` those versions will be
compared according to the following rules:

#. if DSL version of ``fuel-ccp`` is less than service's DSL version -
   they are incompatible - error will be printed, deployment will be
   aborted;
#. if ``MAJOR`` parts of these versions are different - they are incompatible
   - error will be printed, deployment will be aborted;
#. otherwise they are compatible and deployment can be continued.

For ``dsl_version`` in ``fuel-ccp`` repository you should increment:

#. MAJOR version when you make incompatible changes in DSL;
#. MINOR version when you make backward-compatible changes in DSL;
#. PATCH version when you make fixes that do not change DSL, but affect
   processing flow.

If you made a change in service definition that is not supposed to work with
the current ```dsl_version```, you should bump it to the minimal appropriate
number.
