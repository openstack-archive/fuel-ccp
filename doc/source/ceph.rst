Ceph Guide
==========

This guide provides an instruction of how to add Ceph support for CCP
deployment.

Prerequirements
===============

It's not the CCP responsibility to deploy Ceph cluster, so it's expected that
working Ceph cluster is already available and accessible from the all k8s
nodes.

Additionally, you need to ensure that these pools are created:

* images
* volumes
* vms

And that users "glance" and "cinder" are created and have these permissions:

::

  client.cinder
        caps: [mon] allow r
        caps: [osd] allow rwx pool=volumes, allow rwx pool=vms, allow rx pool=images
  client.glance
        caps: [mon] allow r
        caps: [osd] allow rwx pool=images, allow rwx pool=vms

.. NOTE:: If you don't have Ceph cluster, but still want to try CCP with Ceph,
   you can use :doc:`ceph_cluster` guide for deploying simple 3 node Ceph cluster.

Deploy CCP with Ceph
====================

In order to deploy CCP with Ceph you have to edit **ccp.yaml**:

::

    configs:
      ceph:
        fsid: "FSID_OF_THE_CEPH_CLUSTER"
        initial_members: "INITIAL_MEMBERS_OF_CEPH_CLUSTER"
        mon_host: "ANY_CEPH_MON_HOSTNAME"
        cinder_enable: true
        cinder_key: "CINDER_CEPH_KEY"
        cinder_rbd_secret_uuid: "RANDOM_UUID"
        glance_enable: true
        glance_key: "GLANCE_CEPH_KEY"
        nova_enable: true

Example:

::

    configs:
      ceph:
        fsid: "afca8524-2c47-4b81-a0b7-2300e62212f9"
        initial_members: "ceph1"
        mon_host: "10.90.0.5"
        cinder_enable: true
        cinder_key: "AQBShfJXID9pFRAAm4VLpbNXa4XJ9zgAh7dm2g=="
        cinder_rbd_secret_uuid: "b416770d-f3d4-4ac9-b6db-b6a7ac1c61c0"
        glance_enable: true
        glance_key: "AQBShfJXzXyNBRAA5kqXzCKcFoPBn2r6VDYdag=="
        nova_enable: true


- **fsid** - Should be the same as **fsid** variable in the ceph cluster
  **ceph.conf** file.
- **initial_members** - Should be the same as **mon_initial_members**
  variable in the ceph cluster **ceph.conf** file.
- **mon_host** - Should contain any ceph mon node IP or hostname.
- ***_key** - Should be taken from the corresponding Ceph user. You can
  use **ceph auth list** command on the Ceph node to fetch list of all users
  and their keys.
- **cinder_rbd_secret_uuid** - Should be randomly generated. You can use
  **uuidgen** command for this.

Now youâ€™re ready to deploy CCP with Ceph support.
