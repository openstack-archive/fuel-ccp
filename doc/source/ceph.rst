Ceph and Swift guide
====================

This guide provides instruction for adding Ceph and Swift support for CCP
deployment.

.. NOTE:: It's expected that an external Ceph cluster is already available and
   accessible from the all k8s nodes. If you don't have a Ceph cluster, but
   still want to try CCP with Ceph, you can use :doc:`ceph_cluster` guide for
   deploying a simple 3 node Ceph cluster.

Ceph
~~~~

Prerequirements
---------------

You need to ensure that these pools are created:

* images
* volumes
* vms

And that users "glance" and "cinder" are created and have these permissions:

::

  client.cinder
        caps: [mon] allow r
        caps: [osd] allow rwx pool=volumes, allow rwx pool=vms, allow rx pool=images
  client.glance
        caps: [mon] allow r
        caps: [osd] allow rwx pool=images, allow rwx pool=vms


Deploy CCP with Ceph
--------------------

In order to deploy CCP with Ceph you have to edit the ``ccp.yaml`` the file:

::

    configs:
      ceph:
        fsid: "FSID_OF_THE_CEPH_CLUSTER"
        mon_host: "CEPH_MON_HOSTNAME"
      cinder:
        ceph:
          enable: true
          key: "CINDER_CEPH_KEY"
          rbd_secret_uuid: "RANDOM_UUID"
      glance:
        ceph:
          enable: true
          key: "GLANCE_CEPH_KEY"
      nova:
        ceph:
          enable: true

Example:

::

    configs:
      ceph:
        fsid: "afca8524-2c47-4b81-a0b7-2300e62212f9"
        mon_host: "10.90.0.5"
      cinder:
        ceph:
          enable: true
          key: "AQBShfJXID9pFRAAm4VLpbNXa4XJ9zgAh7dm2g=="
          rbd_secret_uuid: "b416770d-f3d4-4ac9-b6db-b6a7ac1c61c0"
      glance:
        ceph:
          enable: true
          key: "AQBShfJXzXyNBRAA5kqXzCKcFoPBn2r6VDYdag=="
      nova:
        ceph:
          enable: true


- ``fsid`` - Should be the same as ``fsid`` variable in the Ceph cluster
  ``ceph.conf`` file.
- ``mon_host`` - Should contain any Ceph mon node IP or hostname.
- ``key`` - Should be taken from the corresponding Ceph user. You can
  use the ``ceph auth list`` command on the Ceph node to fetch list of all
  users and their keys.
- ``rbd_secret_uuid`` - Should be randomly generated. You can use the
  ``uuidgen`` command for this.

Make sure that your deployment topology has a ``cinder`` service. You could
use ``etc/topology-with-ceph-example.yaml`` as a reference.

Now youâ€™re ready to deploy CCP with Ceph support.

Swift
~~~~~

Prerequirements
---------------

Make sure that your deployment topology has a ``radosgw`` service. You could
use ``etc/topology-with-ceph-example.yaml`` as a reference.

Deploy CCP with Swift
---------------------

.. NOTE:: Currently, in CCP, only Glance supports Swift as a backend.

In order to deploy CCP with Swift you have to edit ``ccp.yaml`` the file:

::

  ceph:
    fsid: "FSID_OF_THE_CEPH_CLUSTER"
    mon_host: "CEPH_MON_HOSTNAME"
  radosgw:
    key: "RADOSGW_CEPH_KEY"
  glance:
    swift:
      enable: true
      store_create_container_on_put: true

Example:

::

  ceph:
    fsid: "afca8524-2c47-4b81-a0b7-2300e62212f9"
    mon_host: "10.90.0.2,10.90.0.3,10.90.0.4"
  radosgw:
    key: "AQBIGP5Xs6QFCRAAkCf5YWeBHBlaj6S1rkcCYA=="
  glance:
    swift:
      enable: true
      store_create_container_on_put: true

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the Glance image upload failed, you should check few things:

- Glance-api pod logs
- Radosgw pod logs
- Keystone pod logs
