Application definition contribution guide
=========================================

This document gives high overview of component repository structure.

Overview
========

CCP provides wide spectrum of operations for microservices manipulations on
Kubernetes cluster. Each microservice is an independent component with
common architecture. Whole data releated to component can be found in the
corresponding repository. The full list of the related components can be found
by `link`_, where each repository has prefix ``fuel-ccp-*``.

Structure
=========

Component repositories have common structure:

1. Docker image related data
----------------------------
   ``docker`` folder with Docker files, which will be used for building docker
   images. Each subfolder will be processed as a separate image for building.
   See detailed instructions are available in the :doc:`docker`.

2. Application definition files
-------------------------------
   All application definition files should be located in the ``service/``
   directory, as a ``component_name.yaml`` file, for example:

   ::

    service/keystone.yaml

   Please refer to :doc:`dsl` for detailed description of CCP DSL syntax.

3. Application related scripts and configs
------------------------------------------

   All templates, such as configs, scripts, etc, which will be used for this
   service, should be located in ``service/<component_name>/files``, for example:

   ::

    service/files/keystone.conf.j2

   All files inside this directory are Jinja2 templates, except the file with
   default variables. Default variables for these templates should be located
   in ``service/files/defaults.yaml`` inside the following section.

   ::

    configs:
      <service_name>:

   Description of available values can be found in the following guide
   :doc:`config/index`.
